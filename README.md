    - Description of gaussian state and gaussian operation and generalisation to multipartite entangled state,
        - Creation of class multipartite state,
        - Visualisation of specific modes from multipartite mode and cov,
    - Computation of the multimode state for different parameters of the loop lines n,m,k,
        - Implementation in spatial domain,
        - Implementation for octorail,
        - Implementation for dual rail,
    - Implementation of gaussian measurement on selected modes and state identification on resulting mode,
    - Implementation of non gaussian measurement on selected modes,
    - Numerical optimisation to search for specific state after gaussian + non gaussian measurement.
